/*
 * Function: mosquitto_topic_matches_sub
 *
 * Check whether a topic matches a subscription.
 *
 * For example:
 *
 * foo/bar would match the subscription foo/# or +/bar
 * non/matching would not match the subscription non/+/+
 *
 * Parameters:
 *      sub -       subscription string to check topic against.
 *      topic -     topic to check.
 *      result -    bool pointer to hold result. Will be set to true if the topic
 *                  matches the subscription.
 *
 * Returns:
 *      MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS -  on success
 *      MOSQ_ERR_INVAL -    if the input parameters were invalid.
 *      MOSQ_ERR_NOMEM -    if an out of memory condition occurred.
